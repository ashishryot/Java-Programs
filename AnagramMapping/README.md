# Anagram Mapping

This program finds if there exists an anagram of the given pattern in the string and outputs the position at which the anagram of the pattern exists.


# Explanation

Example:
s="cbaaebca"		p="abc"<br>
Output will be: [0,5]<br>
this is because cba is an anagram of abc,<br>
and bca is also an anagram of abc.<br>
The starting position of subString cba is 0 and for bca is 5, therefore, we output the result [0,5]
